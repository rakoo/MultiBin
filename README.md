# MultiBin

This is a new version of
[ZeroBin](https://github.com/sebsauvage/ZeroBin) in CouchDB.

## Installation

  ```
  1. git clone git://github.com/rakoo/Multibin.git
  2. cd MultiBin
  3. couchapp push . http://localhost:5984/multibin
  ```

CouchApps are a breeze to use, aren't them ?

## Demo

You can see what it looks like
[here](https://krakotztest.iriscouch.com/multibin/_design/MultiBin/index.html).

Be advised : this is a test service : data can be deleted at any time.

## Why CouchDB ?

Because it is an awesome piece of tech, and I like it. There are also
more valid reason:

- One software. Instead of needing a webserver with PHP, you now only
  need CouchDB. It also has the benefit of storing everything in a
  database instead of plain files (note: plain files are not especially
      that bad).
- Replication ! You want to replicate someone else's multibin ?
  
  ```
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5984/_replicator -d '{"_id":"from_source", "source":"http://source.com/multibin", "target":"multibin", "create_target":"true"}'
  ```

  And you're done. You can even use continuous replication, to provide a
  live backup of the source multibin... This is the true power of
  CouchDB.

  Note that this will also replicate the application, so you won't have
  to install it manually.

## No drawbacks ?

Yes, there is one : most (if not all) online hosting
services provide a Webserver with PHP. Only a few provide CouchDB. If
you want to use it, chances are you'll do it from home. But this is what
Internet is, after all. =]
